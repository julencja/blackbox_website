A weekend after "Clojure West":http://clojurewest.org/ we invite you to come and join "Clojure on the Penninsula":http://www.meetup.com/The-Bay-Area-Clojure-User-Group/events/55667422/ meetup, hosted for the first time at the "*blackbox mansion*":http://blackbox.vc/mansion.

The meetings have been in SF recently and there is a lot of people excited about Clojure and interested in meeting others in the SV area. So, in cooperation with "BA Lisp":http://balisp.org/ this is going to be the first in a series of Clojure meetups hosted in the peninsula.
