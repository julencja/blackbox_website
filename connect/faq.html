        <h3>Is it for everyone who has the money to pay the program fee?</h3>

        <h3>What does a typical day of the program look like?</h3>
        <p>Though the program agenda will be very packed, we make sure that you have time to keep your hand on the pulse of your startup and do what needs to be done. The mornings here are for you to tend to your business, have meetings, or connect with your team back home. The program schedule for talks and workshops begins each day around noon and goes through the afternoon and early evenings.</p>

        <h3>What is the venue like?</h3>
        <p>Talks, workshops and accommodation are all in the beautiful <a href="/mansion/">Blackbox Mansion</a> in Atherton, just around 10 minutes car ride away from Stanford, Palo Alto and/or Sand Hill Road where other lectures and workshops will be delivered. There is a pool and jacuzzi, and California sun, so bring your swimsuit:) The participants stay in shared rooms. We always make sure that female participants have a "girls-only" room.</p>

        <h3>What if I want my own private room?</h3>
        <p>Several hotel options are available at your expense, hotel rates range from $100 to about $500 per night.</p>

        <h3>Is transportation provided?</h3>
        <p>No, but you may rent a car and parking is available for free. Public transportation such as train and buses are available, but not frequently. Taxis are available by calling them; they charge ~ $5/mile.</p>

        <h3>When and how do I pay?</h3>
