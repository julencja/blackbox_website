            <h3>International Feel</h3>
            <p>I had a really good time staying at the Blackbox Mansion. It has a real international feel - as well as several people from across the United States, there were people from Spain, Denmark, Romania, Australia and South Africa. The house is really nice, with dedicated office where you can work in peace, and everyone's really friendly and social.</p> 
            <p>It's great to be able to bounce ideas off and discuss problems with people who are doing the same thing. Definitely a great place to stay if you're coming to the Bay Area to launch your startup.</p>

            <h3>Meeting New People</h3>
            <p>Fadi was a great host and I truly enjoyed the experience at the house. It is centrally located to easily get to Palo Alto and have meetings with people in the area, however also close to the CalTrain to get into SF. Meeting new people at the house is the primary benefit as everyone is working on interesting projects and can help you think through different aspects of your business and also highlight things about the "startup scene" that you might not be aware of. Great place to stay!</p>

             <h3>Brilliant Space</h3>
             <p>As a startup founder, I found Blackbox Mansion to be a brilliant living and co-working space in the Valley. It had a homely feel, fantastic people (mostly other founders), and had plenty of places to work or relax. I ended up extending my initial 7 day booking quite significantly to soak up more of the unique Silicon Valley lifestyle that Blackbox Mansion delivers.</p>
             <p>Whilst the location is best suited to those who have a car, if you're not afraid of walking or bussing it to the Caltrain, you can easily get up to San Francisco or to the other locations of the Valley.</p>

             <h3>Fascinating Projects</h3>
             <p>You're an entrepreneur who is new to the area? This is the place for you! I found myself in a group discussion with Steve Blank only 12 hours after I arrived here.</p>
             <p>Entrepreneurs working on fascinating projects drop by all the time, the hosts are very accommodating and knowledgable about the area. So whether you just want to test the water of the Valley or you want to take your project to the fast lane - do it here ;)</p>
